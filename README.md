# GalagaUnityExercise
A retro spaceship game.  
(Be careful of the aliens!)

# MVC Paradigm
This project architecture is designed with the MVC paradigm.
It is an efficient design pattern that makes projects less tightly-coupled and have less dependencies.

# Dependencies Note
I decided to not use Zenject in this project, because MVC and Observer patterns are helpul with solving dependencies.
I would definitely use Zenject in the future, as it is a great way of solving these issues.
